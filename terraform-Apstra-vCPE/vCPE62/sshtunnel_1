# password authentication is not possible, public key authentication must be used.
# set "option IdentityFile" to he file from which the identity (private key) for RSA or DSA authentication is read.  
# The default is ~/.ssh/identity for protocol version 1, and ~/.ssh/id_rsa and ~/.ssh/id_dsa for protocol version 2.
# ssh will also try to load certificate information from the filename obtained by appending -cert.pub to identity filenames.
